**Aerosol Dreams**

A virtual mural maker for the modern artist.

*Description*

Aerosol Dreams is a cutting-edge platform that revolutionizes the concept of murals in the digital age. Why paint on a wall when the whole world can be your canvas?

With Aerosol Dreams, artists can:

_Digitally Paint Buildings_: Use devices like iPads to paint directly on a photograph of a building or even the sky.
_Upload Existing Art_: Have an AI-generated masterpiece or another digital artwork? Simply upload it!

*Benefits*

_Preservation_: While murals are beautiful, they can degrade over time or might not be feasible on certain historical structures. With Aerosol Dreams, we can preserve the physical essence of the building while providing artists with an unlimited canvas.
_Digital Showcase_: Artwork is showcased through augmented reality (AR). Explorers walking in the vicinity of a digital mural get notified, and through the magic of AR, can view the artwork as if it was physically there.

*Features*

_User Authentication_: Secure login system for artists and explorers.
_AR Integration_: Leveraging AR technology, art pieces are displayed in real-world locations.
_AI Assistance_: Using color recognition and location coordinates, the platform determines the optimal placement and appearance of the artwork on a building.
_Notifications_: Explorers are notified when they are near a digital mural, enhancing discovery and interaction.

*How It Works*

Artist Mode:
Log in and select a building or the sky as your canvas.
Choose between digitally painting on it or uploading an existing artwork.
Submit your artwork for the world to see.
Explorer Mode:
Get notified when you are near a digital mural.
Open your camera and the website will use AR and AI to overlay the art on the real world.

*Future Plans*

Artist Collaboration: Multiple artists can collaborate on a single piece, adding their unique touch to a collaborative masterpiece.
Interactive Art: Introduce elements that react to the environment or viewers, making each mural a unique experience.
